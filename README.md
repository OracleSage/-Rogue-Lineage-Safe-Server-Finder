Your exploit needs to support writefile and syn.queue_on_teleport()
Copy the code in USETHIS.lua and paste it into your script executor (EX. syanapse x)
Make sure to input the settings in the script
Make sure to have ic3's account manager downloaded which can be found here: https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager/issues
Make sure that the EnableWebServer in the settings of the account manager is set to true
The settings can be edited by going RAMSettings.ini inside the Account Manager Folder
